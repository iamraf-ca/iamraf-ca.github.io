Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael Dias. I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and living in Toronto now after I immigrate to Canada.

I have been going as **"Toguko"** since my days, mostly nights, on a dial internet, talking on IRC channels, trying to learn about Back Orifice and SubSeven backdoors and playing CS 1.0 Warcraft III battles on LAN Houses in my youth.

I have been involved in IT for more than 20 years, first as an IT Support Leader in a University.
After my graduation on Computer Network, I started as Network Specialist for a Telecom company, setting up backbone Routers, MetroEthernet, DSLANs; Later on the same company as a Business Analyst/Project Manager managing the expansion of the broadband network and other projects.

During my path to became Permanent Resident in Canada, I worked out of IT in Toronto, and for three years, I supervised a team on a giant Condo Construction in Toronto.
It was a great time working on my soft skills managing and supervising people, doing conflict de-escalation, and most importantly, my English hugely improved.

Now I'm studying Cyber Security; I finished a Cyber Security Bootcamp with LightHouse in partnership with [CybNB](https://cybernb.ca/CyberBootcamp.htm), and I got help from [Invest Ottawa](https://www.investottawa.ca/xtreme-talent-accelerator/application/) in a program called Xtreme Talent Accelerator, thanks for all team XTAP!

My goal now is to reach the Top 1% globally on the [Try Hack Me platform](https://tryhackme.com/p/toguko) and Top 10 on the Canadian Rank.
Also, start doing some Capture the Flag games, keep studying for Pentest, Bug Bounty programs and get some certifications in the Cyber Security world.
